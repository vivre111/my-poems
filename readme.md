Just some poems I write. Somehow they gush from my heart and paint its colors. Some pictures a clear blue sky, some the falling embers. 

Someday I plan to add some context about each poem. Maybe I'll be accused of being “an idealist, a bad poet and an honest man”.

Sorry for the poor filename choice =0=.

Thanks for reading :)
